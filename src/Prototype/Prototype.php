/**
 * Prototype Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Produce new objects by copying existing ones without compromising
 * their internal structure.
 *
 * Example: The Prototype pattern provides a convenient way to replicate
 * existing objects instead of reconstructing them and copying over all of their
 * fields directly. The direct approach not only couples you to the classes of
 * the objects being cloned, but also doesn't allow you to copy the contents of
 * the private fields. The Prototype pattern lets you perform the cloning within
 * the context of the cloned class, where the access to the class' private
 * fields is not restricted.
 *
 * This example shows you how to clone a complex Page object using the Prototype
 * pattern. The Page class has lots of private fields, which will be carried
 * over to the cloned object thanks to the Prototype pattern.
